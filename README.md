freqBinRec.c----Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time                       complexity is O(logn).

rotClockMin.c----A sorted array is rotated clockwise at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it. 

missAPBin.c------ Given an array that represents elements of arithmetic progression in order. One element is missing in the progression,                     find the missing number.
