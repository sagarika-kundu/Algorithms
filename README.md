[MergeSort.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/MergeSort.c)------ MergeSort an array of n elements.

[freqBinRec.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/freqBinRec.c)----Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time                       complexity is O(logn).

[rotClockMin.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/rotClockMin.c)----A sorted array is rotated clockwise at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it. 

[missAPBin.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/missAPBin.c)------ Given an array that represents elements of arithmetic progression in order. One element is missing in the progression,                     find the missing number. 

[bitonic.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/bitonic.c)--------  A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing. A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing. Find bitonic point in a bitonic sequence.  

[invPairs.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/invPairs.c)------- ( How Close a Data is To Being Sorted? ) Apply Merge Sort to count inversion pairs in an array. Two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion pair if a[i] > a[j] and i < j. Example: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3). 

[sumBin.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/sumBin.c)---------  Given a sorted array and a number X, search two elements of array s.t. their sum is X. 

[twoDimArr.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/twoDimArr.c)------ Apply Binary Search on 2D NxM array (A) having numbers stored in non-deceasing order under row-major scanning. Hint: k-th element = A[k/M][k % M]  4

[median.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/median.c)--------- Median of two sorted arrays: There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays (i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n))

[BFS.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/BFS.cpp)---------- Breadth First Search of a Graph using STL.

[DFS.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/DFS.cpp)---------- Depth First Search of a Graph using STL.

[node_level.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/node_level.cpp)--- Finding number of nodes at a given level 'x' in an undirected graph ( BFS )

[unreach.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/unreach.cpp) ----- Nodes not reachable from a source node 'x' using DFS (can be done using BFS)

[kruskal.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/kruskal.cpp) ----- Given a weighted undirected graph find the sum of weights of edges of a Minimum Spanning Tree.(Union function used here has O(n^2) time complexity)

[countSort.c](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/countSort.c) ----- Given an array of digits, sort them with time complexity O(n).

[permute.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/permute.cpp) ----- Print all permutations of a given string.

[nQueen.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/nQueen.cpp) -------- The N-Queen Problem where n is less than a given value(assumed n < 100).

[nQueenAllSolns.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/nQueenAllSolns.cpp)----- Printing all possible solutions of the N-Queen problem where n is less than a given value(assumed n < 100).

[ratMaze.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/ratMaze.cpp)---------- A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.[In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.]

[primPQ.cpp](https://github.com/sagarika3kundu/Algorithms/blob/master/primPQ.cpp) ------ Primâ€™s algorithm using priority_queue in STL
