# Algorithms
freqBinRec.c----Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time                       complexity is O(logn).

rotClockMin.c----A sorted array is rotated clockwise at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it. 

missAPBin.c------ Given an array that represents elements of arithmetic progression in order. One element is missing in the progression,                     find the missing number. 

bitonic.c--------  A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing. A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing. Find bitonic point in a bitonic sequence.  

invPairs.c------- Apply Merge Sort to count inversion pairs in an array. Two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion pair if a[i] > a[j] and i < j. Example: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3). 

sumBin.c---------  Given a sorted array and a number X, search two elements of array s.t. their sum is X.
