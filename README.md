# Algorithms
MergeSort------ MergeSort an array of n elements.

freqBinRec.c----Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time                       complexity is O(logn).

rotClockMin.c----A sorted array is rotated clockwise at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it. 

missAPBin.c------ Given an array that represents elements of arithmetic progression in order. One element is missing in the progression,                     find the missing number. 

bitonic.c--------  A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing. A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing. Find bitonic point in a bitonic sequence.  

invPairs.c------- ( How Close a Data is To Being Sorted? ) Apply Merge Sort to count inversion pairs in an array. Two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion pair if a[i] > a[j] and i < j. Example: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3). 

sumBin.c---------  Given a sorted array and a number X, search two elements of array s.t. their sum is X. 

twoDimArr.c------ Apply Binary Search on 2D NxM array (A) having numbers stored in non-deceasing order under row-major scanning. Hint: k-th element = A[k/M][k % M]  4

median.c--------- Median of two sorted arrays: There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays (i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n))

BFS.cpp---------- Breadth First Search of a Graph using STL.

DFS.cpp---------- Depth First Search of a Graph using STL.

node_level.cpp--- Finding number of nodes at a given level 'x' in an undirected graph ( BFS )

unreach.cpp ----- Nodes not reachable from a source node 'x' using DFS (can be done using BFS)

kruskal.cpp ----- Given a weighted undirected graph. Find the sum of weights of edges of a Minimum Spanning Tree.(Union function used here has O(n^2) time complexity)

countSort.c ----- Given an array of digits, sort them with time complexity O(n).
